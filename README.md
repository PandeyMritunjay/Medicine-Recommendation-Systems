## Overview
This project develops a machine learning-based drug recommendation system aimed at providing quick and reliable medical prescriptions during emergencies. Utilizing advanced computational methods, the system predicts the most effective drug combinations based on a patientâ€™s health state, leveraging vast amounts of Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

## Features
- __Personalized Drug Recommendations__: Suggests medications based on individual patient data, including symptoms, blood pressure, and other health parameters.
- __Emergency Readiness__: Particularly useful in urgent health scenarios where quick decision-making is crucial.
- __Resource Efficiency__: Optimizes the use of medical resources by providing accurate and timely recommendations.
- __Privacy and Integrity__: Ensures the privacy of patient data while maintaining the integrity of medical advisories.
